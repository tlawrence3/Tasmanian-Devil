FILE DESCRIPTION for EXAMO
The following are the description of the files:
git/EXAMO-reborn/iMM904_Testing/160202_Model_Conversion_Testing/
	This contains the files necessary to convert any .xml or .mat metabolic reconstruction in the necessary .pkl file format for EXAMO (and/or make desired changes and convert the model to a COBRA compatible .mat format). 
	-160415_import_cobra_model_46_iMM904.py imports the model and generates the output .pkl EXAMO and .mat COBRA files. Below is the program description upon entering python 160416_import_cobra_model_46_iMM904.py -h: 		
		Convert SBML model (.xml or .mat file) into EXAMO pickle file

		positional arguments:
		  s           Necessary variable: SBML file
		  b           Necessary variable: biomass rxn; Append "R_" to the front if the
    		              reaction name does not begin with this
  		  e           Necessary variable: extracellular compartment abbreviation.
              		      Instead of brackets, use underscores (ex: "_e")

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
		  -l L        lb file
		  -u U        ub file
		  -g G        gene2rxn file
		  -m M        metabolite mapping complexes .pkl file. Must first create .pkl
		              file if using this option
		  -n N        nucleotide conversions .pkl file. Must first create .pkl file if
		              using this option
		  -c C        metabolite to carbon mapping file

	To create a model with metabolite mappings, nucleotide conversion, and carbon mappings as an example, the command would be:
		python 151022_import_cobra_model_46_iMM904.py iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm.xml R_biomass_published _e -m 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_metabolite_mappings.pkl -n 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_nucleotide_conversions.pkl -c iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_metabolite_dict.csv > test.txt
	- iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_genes_genes2rxns.txt is an example if you wanted to change the gene2rx mappings for reactions. The lb and ub files wouuld be formatted the same way, with the boundaries on a new line for each respective reaction in the model.
	- 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_metabolite_mappings.pkl is an example of a metabolite mappings dictionary. This was produced by 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_metabolite_mappings.py
	- 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_nucleotide_conversions.pkl is an example of a nucleotide conversions dictionary. This was produced by 150723_iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_nucleotide_conversions.py.
	- iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm_metabolite_dict.csv contains the format needed to map the number of carbons to every metabolite and create a carbon balanced model, eliminating nonbalanced reactions if neccessary. 
		*To note, eliminating rxns that are not carbon balanced may result in the model not being solvable for a biomass flux if the metabolites involved are the only way to produce certain metabolites in the biomass reaction.


git/EXAMO-reborn/151113_iMM904_Testing
	This contains the files necessary to run EXAMO.  
	-160720_01_findZeroAndHighFreqRxns_1.py is the first script of the original EXAMO package and determines high frequency and zero frequency reactions. Below is the program description upon entering python 150720_01_findZeroAndHighFreqRxns_1.py:
		_01_findZeroAndHighFreqRxns.py

		positional arguments:
		  s           Necessary variable: SBML file
		  p           Necessary variable: pickle file
		  d           Necessary variable: condition description
		  b           Necessary variable: biomass reaction

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
		  -e E        Minimum value for fluxes forced to be non-zero (for the
		              implementation of the pathway algorithm created by Shlomi);
		              default value: 1E-1
		  -a A        Activity threshold (above which a flux is considered to be
		              larger than 0); default value: 1E-10
		  -o O        Defined biomass production

	To run the first script with a defined biomass for example for the Aerobic condition for iMM904, the command would be:	
		python 150720_01_findZeroAndHighFreqRxns_1.py iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm.xml iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm.pkl 151006_Aerobic_0.25 R_biomass_published -o 0.2879
	-150723_02_04.py is the second through fourth scirpts of the original EXAMO package. This runs the MBA profile, then adds back the most occurring reactions to the core high frequency reactions until biomass produced, and then the minimziation of fluxes is determiend. Below is the program description upon entering python 150723_02_04.py -h
		_02_04.py

		positional arguments:
		  s                     Necessary variable: SBML file
		  p                     Necessary variable: pickle file
		  d                     Necessary variable: condition description
		  b                     Necessary variable: biomass reaction
		  r                     Necessary variable: number of repetitions of the 2nd-
		                        4th scripts for final flux states

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
		  -e E                  Minimum value for active flux of reversible reactions
		                        in an irreversible model; default value: 1E-10
		  -a A                  Activity threshold (above which a flux is considered
		                        to be larger than 0); default value: 1E-10
		  -t T                  Activity threshold for finding active reactions;
		                        default value: 1E-10
		  -o O                  Defined biomass production
		  -EXrxns EXRXNS        Pickle file containing extracellular reactions list
		  -EXtrrxns EXTRRXNS    Pickle file containing extracellular transport
		                        reactions list
		  -Othertrrxns OTHERTRRXNS
		                        Pickle file containing other compartmental transport
		                        reactions list
	To run the second through fourth scripts with 5 repetitions defined biomass and adjusted miminum value for active flux, activity threshold, and activity threshold for finding active reactions, the command would be:
		python 150723_02_04.py iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm.xml iMM904_NADcorrected_1127_FTHFLm.pkl 151006_Aerobic_0.25 R_biomass_published 5 -o 0.2879 -e 1E-9 -a 1E-9 -t 1E-9
	-iMM904_EXtrrxns.pkl is aan example of extracellular transport reactions created by iMM904_EXtrrxns.py.
	-iMM904_EXrxns.pkl is an example of extracellular reactions created by iMM904_EXrxns.py.
	-iMM904_Othertrrxns.pkl is an example of other compartmental transport reactions created by iMM904_Othertrrxns.py. 
	-To note, the .pkl and .xml or .mat metabolic reconstructions need to be in the data subfolder, along with the gene rules.csv file. 



git/EXAMO-reborn/Gene_Rules
